# Slipshow examples

This directory contains both full-fledged presentations and many smaller
examples. They were made with a specific Slipshow version, but they will be
maintained to work with the latest Slipshow version.

However, the code may not follow best practices: they are before all
presentations that were made to present something, often with limited time for
preparation.

You can see the rendered version and code of these presentation in the docs.
