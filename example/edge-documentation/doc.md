# The Workflow

{.block title="What to do"}
1. Choose something you want to improve in the doc.

2. Use the compass.

3. Improve the doc following the style guide for the type of documentation.

4. Publish.

----------
1. Show initial docs. Let's improve that.
2. Fortunately, writing documentation is very easy (just like UI, UX, design, ...). What's hard is writing code.
3. (This guy is wrong)
4. Although I did write code, that's the second part of the talk.

## Writing doc is hard

Struggled with duplicated content:

Struggled with structure.

Spent way too long with that.

## Fortunately we have tooling

Small Language Model. Two parameters, each can be 0 or 1.

Action vs Cognition

Acquisition vs Application

Focus on each of these.

Before, my "Syntax reference" page, was here on this map.

This is a *compass*. It helps you navigate
