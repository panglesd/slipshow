## **Slipshow and scrolling presentations.**

In a slipshow presentation, the equivalent of a slide is called a _slip_. Each slip is like a slide, but with no bottom limit. That is, the content can be arbitrarily long! During the presentation, the camera will "scroll" down to reveal the hidden content, following a script given by the presenter!

Slipshow innovates compared to traditional slide-based engine in the following ways:
- Scroll on a slip instead of changing slides, making content reveal more continuous,
- Record hand-drawings when preparing the talk, edit them and have them replayed during the presentation,
- Include any custom script you need to make your presentation clearer through eg animation.

Slipshow compiles files written in an extension of markdown, to a standalone html file viewable offline in any web browser.
