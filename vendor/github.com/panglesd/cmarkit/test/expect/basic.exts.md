## Footnotes

This is a footnote in history[^1] with mutiple references[^1]
and even [text references][^1]

 [^1]: And it can have
lazy continuation lines and multiple paragraphs

  If you indent one column after the footnote label start.

      cb
  * list item
ablc
  * another item


 This is no longer the footnote.

Can we make footnotes in footnotes[^2] ?

[^2]: This gets tricky but I guess we could have a footnote[^tricky] in
  a footnote. Also footnote[^1] in footnotes[^2] is[^3] tricky for getting
  all back references rendered correctly.

  [^tricky]: The foot of the footnote. But that's not going to link back[^2]

  Second footnote

Not the footnote

[^3]:

Not the footnote but a reference to an empty footnote[^3]

Not a footnote [^]

[^]: not a footnote.


## Strikethrough

The stroken ~~*emph*~~.

Nesting the nest ~~*emph* ~~stroke~~ *emph **emph  ~~strikeagain~~***~~

There must be no blanks after the opener and before the closer. This
is ~~ not an opener and ~~this won't open ~~that does~~.

* Here we have ~~stroken `code`~~.
* Here we have ~~nested ~~stroken~~ ok~~

## Math

The inline $\sqrt{x^2-1}$ equation.

There must be no blanks after the opener and before the closer. This
makes so you can donate $5 or $10 dollars here and there without problem.

There is no such think as nesting $\sqrt{x^2-1}$+3$+3$. As usual
delimiters can be \$escaped\$ $\sqrt{16\$}$

Amazing, this is [hyperlinked math $3x^2$](https://example.org)

The HTML renderer should be careful with $a < b$ escapes.

Display math can be in `math` code blocks.

```math
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 < \Phi
```

But it can also be in $$ \left( \sum_{k=1}^n
   a_k b_k \right)^2 < \Phi $$


## List task items

* [ ] Task open
* [x] Task done
* [X] Task done
*  [✓] Task done (U+2713, CHECK MARK)
*   [✔] Task done (U+2714, HEAVY CHECK MARK)
        Indent
* Of course this can all be nested
  * [𐄂] Task done (U+10102, AEGEAN CHECK MARK)
        It will be done for sure.

            code block
           Not a code block
  * [x] Task done
  * [~] Task cancelled
        Paragraphy
  * [~] Task canceled 
  
            we have a code block here too.
  * [x]Not a task
  * \[x] Not a task

* [ ]
* [ ] a

          Code
         Not code

* [ ]
          Code
         Not code


## Tables

A sample table:

| Id | Name  | Description            | Link                |
|:--:|------:|:-----------------------|--------------------:|
| 1  | OCaml | The OCaml website      | <https://ocaml.org> |
| 2  | Haskell | The Haskell website | <https://haskell.org> |
| 3 | MDN Web docs | Web dev docs | <https://developer.mozilla.org/> |
| 4 | Wikipedia | The Free Encyclopedia | <https://wikipedia.org> |

Testing these non separator pipes.

| Fancy | maybe | hu\|glu |
|-------|-------|-------|
| *a | b* | `code |` | [bl|a] |
| not \| two cols | $\sqrt(x^2 - 1)$ |

[bl|a]: https://example.org


A table with changing labels and alignement:

 | h1  |  h2 |
 |-----|:---:|
 | 1   | 2   |
 | h3  | h4  |
 |:----|----:|
 | 3   | 4   |

A simple header less table with left and right aligned columns

 |:--|--:|
 | 1 | 2 |

The simplest table:

 | 1 | 2 |

A header only table:

| h1 | h2 |
|:--:|:--:|

Maximal number of columns all rows defines number of colums:

   | h1 | h2 | h3 |
   |:---|:--:|---:|
  |left | center | right |
   | ha!  | four | columns | in fact |
   |||||
   ||||a|

Header less table:

  |header|less|
  |this | is |

Another quoted header less table with aligement

> |----:|----:|
> | header | less |
> | again | aligned |

This is an empty table with three columns:

## Attributes

### Block attributes

{#my-id}
This is a paragraph with the `my-id` is.

{#your-id #my-id}
I have `your-id`, not mine

{id="his-id" #your-id #my-id}
I have `his-id`, not mine, not yours

{.blue}
#### This is a title with the `.blue` class

{key=value}
- This is an item where `key` has value `value`.
- It is not possible to attach attributes to list items... yet

{key="value" flag .my-class #my-id}
I'm a paragraph with many attributes

{key="value" flag .my-class #my-id}
{key2="value2" flag2 .my-class2}
I have much more attribute than the previous one, since they stack

{#my-id}
{#your-id}
I have your id

{.class1 class="class2 class3" class=class4}
I have a lot of class: `class1`, `class2`, `class3` and `class4`

{.class1 class="class2 class3"}
{class=class4}
Me too!

{       #space-do-not-matter       }
But spaceships matter.

{key="a value with a }"}
Some word

{introducing standalone attributes}

{.standalone #attributes}
{also="stack"}

### Inline attributes

{.I am} not a block attribute, but a standalone inline attribute, as I have content in the line.

In the middle of paragraphs, {.inline #attributes} work.

Similarly, at the end, they work {as=well}

Without specified delimitations, inline attributes are either {standalone} or attached to the left-closest{word}.

Inline attributes can [refer to many]{words} including [with **inline**]{.bold}.

Attributes can be nested: [link [with]{attrs}](example.com), [attrs [with
link](example.com)]{attrs}, [attrs [within]{attrs1}]{attrs2}.

Attributes can be attached without squares, for instance this{#idee} has an
id. This `codeblock`{#too}! This ![image](as){#well}. [Links](work){#the .same}. **Emphasis**{and} and *italic1*{and} _italic2_{too}!

Testing ~~strikethrough~~{text}.

{#id}
## Title with an id

{#id}
Title with an id
================


### Attributes definition

We can provide [attributes][a] definition to [avoid][a] [cluttering] a [line with][a] attributes.

[cluttering]: {#clut}
[a]: {.important-word}

Attributes attached to attribute definition do nothing:

A [b][attr-attached-def] c

{.not-present}
[attr-attached-def]: {.present}

However, for link definition, they are present:

A [b][link-def-with-attrs] c

{.present}
[link-def-with-attrs]: http://example.com
