Blocks and inlines
==================

In what follows, we will make a difference between what we call blocks, and inlines.

Inlines are the elements that are inside the flow of the text. For instance, bold text, links, italic, mathematic formulas.

Blocks, on the contrary, make the structure of the text. For instance paragraphs, titles, bullet lists, are blocks, as well as columns in a multi-column layout.

This distinction will be important when styling with attributes (TODO: do).
