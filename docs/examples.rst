Examples

In this page, you'll find a number of examples of "real life" Slipshow
presentation. This can help in two ways:

- It can give you an idea of what you can do with Slipshow, especially if you
  are only used to slides.
- You can peek at the source to learn how to achieve certain effects, if you
  don't find them in the doc or want bigger examples.

I'm the author of some presentations, other are authored by other person who
kindly allowed me to list them here. Some of them have have the source
available, other keep it private.

I will make sure that my own presentations always work with the latest version
of Slipshow. However, "external" presentations might require an older version of
Slipshow.

Note also that being "real-life" presentation, they were made under time
constraints, sometimes using older versions with less features in the
language. So the code is probably not the cleanest, and that is fine.
