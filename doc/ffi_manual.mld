{0 Brr FFI manual}

This manual describes how OCaml and JavaScript values are represented
by [js_of_ocaml] and Brr. The companion {{!page-ffi_cookbook}FFI
cookbook} has a few tips and off-the-shelf design answers for common
JavaScript bindings scenarios.

An OCaml value compiled by [js_of_ocaml] is encoded as a JavaScript
value (see {{:http://doi.org/10.1002/spe.2187}this paper} for outdated
yet interesting details). JavaScript does not understand this
encoding, conversly OCaml does not understand JavaScript values
directly.  The {e foreign function interface} (FFI) reconciles these
views.

{1:foreword Foreword}

The official [js_of_ocaml] JavaScript foreign function interface
encodes and structurally types JavaScript objects as OCaml object
phantom types. This is a very neat trick and topped with the custom
syntax offered by [js_of_ocaml-ppx] this means that you can write
perfectly typed and idiomatic JavaScript code in OCaml with
unscrutable type error messages.

We are not keen to program in JavaCamlScript. We are not keen to have
to use the round corner of the OCaml language. We are not keen to use
an ad-hoc syntax powered by the horrific and brittle [ppx] system. We
want to tap into the browser APIs for the functionality they provide,
not for the programming idioms they propose.

In particular we are not attached to the JavaScript object system and
do not feel the need to model it into OCaml types. In Brr we simply
hide JavaScript objects behind abstract OCaml types which are acted
upon using regular OCaml functions. JavaScript being quite sane about
its object-orientation, the occasional mixin or inheritance
relationship can be handled with explicit coercions functions.

This approach exposes the browser APIs in a simple way for both
newcomers and working OCaml programmers who can harness the power of
the excellent work that went into the [js_of_ocaml] compiler and its
runtime without the need to submit to [ppx] and less travelled parts
of the language.

{1:js_values JavaScript values}

JavaScript values are represented in OCaml programs by the {!Jv.t}
type. A value of this type represents any
{{:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Data_and_Structure_types}JavaScript
value}: [null], [undefined], a boolean, a number, a string, an array,
an object, a function, etc.

Except for JavaScript strings which are represented by values of type
{!Jstr.t} nothing is done to type JavaScript values beyond this
universal type. JavaScript bindings glue is in charge of manipulating
{!Jv.t} values of specific object types and expose them as type safe
interfaces by using OCaml abstract types.

The {!Jv.repr} function returns the JavaScript representation of any
OCaml value, it is the moral equivalent of {!Obj.repr} for the
JavaScript encoding of OCaml values made by [js_of_ocaml] compilation.

{1:equality Equality}

The {!Jv} module provides access to JavaScript equality operators
on {!Jv.t} values:
{ul
{- {!Jv.equal} is JavaScript's {{:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Equality}[==]}, which tries
   to convert operands of different types to assess equality.}
{- {!Jv.strict_equal} is JavaScript's strict equality {{:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Strict_equality}[===]}
   which always considers operands of different types to be different}}

The OCaml [( = )] structural equality is implemented as per OCaml
semantics on OCaml values. What it does on JavaScript values does not
seem to be properly documented (get in touch if you know any better) –
you will have to make sense of
{{:https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml/blob/master/runtime/compare.js}
the source}.

The OCaml [( == )] physical equality is compiled to JavaScript's
strict equality [===].

To sum up we have:

{v
OCaml             Compiled JavaScript
---------------------------------------
Jv.equal          ==
Jv.strict_equal   ===
( = )             caml_equal
( == )            ===
v}

{1:null_undefined Null and undefined}

Values of type {!Jv.t} can {e always} be [null] or [undefined]. In
what follows we call {e safe} a value that is guaranteed not be [null]
or [undefined] and {e unsafe} one that may be.

OCaml got rid of null pointer errors so don't let these values go back
haunt your stack traces. Make sure to always handle them immediately
in the context where they occur – otherwise they will propagate and
blow up in your face at unrelated points in your code.

[null] is represented by {!Jv.null} and [undefined] by
{!Jv.undefined}. You can test for them with the {!Jv.is_null} and
{!Jv.is_undefined} predicates which make sure to use the correct
JavaScript equality function.

{[
let is_null = Jv.is_null jv            (* true iff [jv] is null *)
let is_undefined = Jv.is_undefined jv  (* true iff [jv] is undefined *)
]}

In general it's a good idea to defensively test for both; the
functions {!Jv.is_none} and {!Jv.is_some} do that directly.

{[
let is_none = Jv.is_none jv  (* true iff null or undefined *)
let is_some = Jv.is_some jv  (* false iff null or undefined *)
]}

For APIs that use these values to denote absence of values, use the
{!Jv.to_option} function when you convert {!Jv.t} values to OCaml
types. It handles [null] and [undefined] by mapping them to [None].

{[
let safe_int : int option = Jv.to_option Jv.to_int jv
let safe_jv : Jv.t option = Jv.to_option Fun.id jv
]}

If you are on the way from OCaml to JavaScript you have to choose to
map [None] values to one of [null], [undefined] or something else. The
[none] argument of {!Jv.of_option} specifies this:

{[
let jv = Jv.of_option ~none:Jv.null Fun.id v         (* None is null *)
let jv = Jv.of_option ~none:Jv.undefined Fun.id v    (* None is undefined *)
let jv = Jv.of_option ~none:Jstr.empty Jv.of_jstr v  (* None is empty *)
]}

{1:bools Booleans}

Values of type {!Jv.t} can represent JavaScript booleans.

{!Jv.of_bool} and {!Jv.to_bool} convert them with OCaml [bool]s.
{!Jv.to_bool} is unsafe, it does not check for [null] or
[undefined]. If needed combine with {!Jv.is_none}:

{[
let safe_bool : bool = if Jv.is_none jv then false else Jv.to_bool jv
]}

OCaml [bool] values are not represented by JavaScript booleans. Make
sure not to directly give a JavaScript boolean to an OCaml function
expecting a [bool] value and vice-versa; always go through the
conversion functions.

{1:nums numbers}

Values of type {!Jv.t} can represent JavaScript numbers.

{!Jv.of_int} and {!Jv.to_int} convert them with OCaml [int]s.
{!Jv.of_float} and {!Jv.to_float} convert them with OCaml [float]s.
Both {!Jv.to_int} and {!Jv.to_float} are unsafe, they do not
check for [null] or [undefined]. If needed combine them
with {!Jv.of_option}:

{[
let i : int option = Jv.to_option Jv.to_int jv
]}

The conversions are lossless, except if you convert a non-integral
JavaScript number with {!Jv.to_int}.

OCaml [int] and [float] values are directly represented by JavaScript
numbers. This means the conversion are nops. Nevertheless use the
conversion functions to insulate yourself of changes [js_of_ocaml]
might make in the future.

{1:strings Strings}

Values of type {!Jv.t} can represent JavaScript strings.

JavaScript strings are immutable sequences of UTF-16 encoded Unicode
text. OCaml [string]s are immutable sequences of bytes and nowadays
assumed to be UTF-8 encoded text {e when interpreted as textual
content}.

Because of this difference we use a dedicated data type {!Jstr.t} for
JavaScript strings. Values of this type directly represent a
JavaScript [String] object. Use {!Jstr.t} values to represent the
strings returned to you by JavaScript APIs, not OCaml [string]s. This
avoids constantly converting representations between UTF-16 and UTF-8.

The {!Jstr.v} function takes an UTF-8 encoded OCaml string and
translates it to an UTF-16 encoded JavaScript string. By UTF-8
encoding OCaml sources this almosts gives us a literal notation for
JavaScript strings:

{[
let s : Jstr.t = Jstr.v "A JavaScript string"
]}

If the OCaml string is only made of US-ASCII characters like above the
[js_of_ocaml] compiler compiles the call and OCaml string literal {e
directly} to a JavaScript string literal. However if the literal has
non US-ASCII Unicode characters, a runtime conversion occurs for now
(see {{:https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml/issues/1034}this
issue}):

{[
let s : Jstr.t = Jstr.v "🐫" (* UTF-8 to UTF-16 conversion at runtime *)
]}

To convert a JavaScript string to an UTF-8 encoded OCaml string use
{!Jstr.to_string}.

Conversion between {!Jv.t} values and {!Jstr.t} are nops, but do use the
{!Jv.of_jstr} and {!Jv.to_jstr} functions.

{1:arrays Arrays}

Values of type {!Jv.t} can represent JavaScript arrays.

The {!Jv.Jarray} module provides functions to directly manipulate
them. In general you will want to convert them to OCaml arrays or
lists, the functions {!Jv.to_array}, {!Jv.of_array}, {!Jv.to_list},
{!Jv.of_list} do this aswell as a few {{!Jv.array_special}specialized}
conversion functions.

JavaScript arrays and OCaml [list]s and [array]s are represented
differently, these conversions are not free.

{1:objs Objects}

Values of type {!Jv.t} can represent JavaScript objects.

{2:global The [global] object}

The
{{:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/globalThis}global
object} is represented by the {!Jv.global} value. This object is used
to access the global scope in window and non-window contexts. For
example to look for functions, object constructors or global
values.

{2:props Properties}

Functions {!Jv.find}, {!Jv.get}, {!Jv.set} and {!Jv.delete} operate on
object properties of {!Jv.t} values. {!Jv.get} returns [undefined] if
the property is undefined and [null] if it is defined but [null]; use
{!Jv.find} to safely map these cases to [None].

{[
let get_prop o = Jv.get o "prop"
let set_prop o v = Jv.set o "prop" v
let delete_prop o = Jv.delete o "prop"
let find_prop o = Jv.find o "prop" (* handles [null] and [undefined] *)
]}

These property functions return and take {!Jv.t} values. In practice
you have to further convert these values to the types they represent.
For example for an [int] property:

{[
let length o = Jv.to_int (Jv.get o "length")
let set_length o l = Jv.set o "length" (Jv.of_int l)
]}

To make these conversions more streamlined for basic types, {!Jv}
provides the {!Jv.Bool}, {!Jv.Int}, {!Jv.Float} and {!Jv.Jstr}
submodules which have property functions converting directly with the
corresponding OCaml types. Using {!Jv.Int} the example above rewrites
to:

{[
let length o = Jv.Int.get o "length"
let set_length l = Jv.Int.set o "length" l
]}

An few other example:

{[
let name o = Jv.Jstr.get o "name"
let set_name o s = Jv.Jstr.set o "name" s
let pi = Jv.Float.get (Jv.get Jv.global "Math") "PI"
]}

{2:uprop Unicode property names}

Most object property names in APIs are made only of US-ASCII
characters. For these properties the functions seen so far work
perfectly.

However if you do hit property names that have arbitrary Unicode
characters you {e cannot} use these. You need to use these primed
primitives: {!Jv.get'}, {!Jv.set'} and {!Jv.delete'}. These functions
take a {!Jstr.t} for the property name:

{[
let pi2_prop = Jstr.v "π²" (* make sure we don't convert on each call *)
let pi2 o = Jv.to_float (Jv.get' o pi2_prop)
]}

{2:create_obj Creating}

A new object can be created via {!Jv.obj} which simply takes an array
of name/value pairs:

{[
let o = Jv.obj Jv.[| "length", of_int 3; "name", of_jstr (Jstr.v "Ha!") |]
]}

If you need to handle full Unicode names use {!Jv.obj'}:

{[
let pi2_prop = Jstr.v "π²" (* make sure we don't convert on each call *)
let o = Jv.obj' Jv.[| pi2_prop, of_float (pi *. pi) |]
]}

{2:create Creating with constructors}

A new object is created with a constructor by first looking the
constructor function in the global object and then call it with
{!Jv.new'}:

{[
let date = Jv.get Jv.global "Date"
let date_of_ptime_ms ms = Jv.new' date [| Jv.of_float ms |]
]}

{2:method Calling methods}

To call a method on a object, construct an OCaml array of {!Jv.t} values
representing the method arguments and use {!Jv.call} on the object

{[
let to_jstr o = Jv.to_jstr (Jv.call o "toString" [||])
]}

{1:funcs Functions}

Values of type {!Jv.t} can represent JavaScript functions and closures.

To call a function, look it up in the global object, construct an OCaml
array of {!Jv.t} values representing the arguments and invoke
{!Jv.apply}.

{[
let atob = Jv.get Jv.global "atob"
let base64 s = Jv.to_jstr @@ Jv.apply atob Jv.[| of_jstr s |]
]}

For information about calling back from JavaScript to OCaml
see the {{!page-ffi_cookbook.callback}cookbook}.

{1:errors Errors and exceptions}

Values of type {!Jv.t} can represent JavaScript [Error] objects.

The {!module:Jv.Error} module has a dedicated type and functions to
handle them. Use the {!Jv.of_error} and {!Jv.to_error} functions to
convert them with {!Jv.t} objects.

JavaScript exceptions are thrown in your face as the OCaml
{!Jv.exception-Error} which holds a {!Jv.Error.t} value. So handling
JavaScript exceptions is just a matter of catching that exception:

{[
let result_of_raising f v = match f v with
| exception (Jv.Error e) -> Error (Jv.Error.message e)
| v -> Ok v
]}

If you want to throw a JavaScript exception yourself from OCaml code
use {!Jv.throw}.

{1:promises Promises}

Values of type {!Jv.t} can represent JavaScript promise objects.

The {!Jv.Promise} module has a type and few functions to handle them
directly. However {!Brr} uses {!Fut} values to safely type them. This
is the module you should use to interact with JavaScript promises, see
the {{!page-ffi_cookbook.promises}cookbook} for explanations.
